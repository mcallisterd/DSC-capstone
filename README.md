# DSC-capstone
Machine learning project using CNNs to classify images of handwritten LaTeX characters. Written in Julia, using the FluxML package for machine learning. Noticeably aided by the FluxML "model zoo" example of writing a MLP model for MNIST (https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/blob/master/vision/mnist/mlp.jl).
